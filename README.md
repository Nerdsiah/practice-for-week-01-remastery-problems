# Remastery Problems

Now that you've solved the REPL Practice Problems, it is time to submit your
solutions.

1. Clone the starter from GitHub.
2. Copy and paste your solution for each problem into the appropriate file.
3. Run each file locally to make sure your functions are still returning the
   correct output. For example, to run the first file, run the following:
   `node 01-last-vowel.js`
4. When all problems are complete, submit your project:
   1. **Delete the `node_modules` directory**
   2. Zip up your folder
   3. Upload it

If you run into any issues cloning the practice, running your files, or zipping
up your submission, reach out to an instructor on Slack.
